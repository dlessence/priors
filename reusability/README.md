# The reusability prior
Paper (in review) [Machine Learning: Science and Technology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2632-2153)


   
   - **March10/2023:** Illustrative code release for review
     * A simple counting algorithm is given [here](reusability/graph/dag.py) for estimating the number of contexts for each learnable parameter.
     * A sample notebook is provided [here](reusability/examples/sample_analyze_efficientnetv2b0.ipynb) for a demonstration of the graph analysis results from the paper.
     * Implementation of scope for aggressive parameter sharing is given [here](reusability/aggressive_sharing/scoped_conv.py)
   - **Next**: Full code release after acceptance.
